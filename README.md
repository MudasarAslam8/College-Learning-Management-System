# College-Learning-Management-System
# Abstract
A learning management system (LMS) is a software application for delivery and management of educational courses. It is a client-server type solution, typically web-based, used to handle student registration, delivery of course content, administration of tests and assignments, and related record keeping. An LMS is particularly useful for fully online courses or training programs. The objective of this Report is two-fold. Firstly, we provide an overview of learning management systems, their architecture, and other features. This summary enables us to identify the software requirements specifications for a new LMS. The second objective of this paper is to describe the creation of our own LMS. This new LMS, College Learning Management System (CLMS) named implements the requirements identified. The main features of (CLMS) Login/Logout, Manage Semester, Manage Fees, Manage Student List, Manage Courses, Manage Subjects, Manage Teachers, Manage Student Attendance. Manage Teacher's Attendance, Manage Student's Fee, Manage Teacher's Schedule, Generates Reports. Backup and Restore Database Login functions are activated for students and instructors.  (CLMS) is capable of serving a wide range of students.  It is customizable, and a number of applications can be integrated with it.
# Introduction
A learning management system (LMS) is a software application or web-based technology used to plan, implement and assess a specific learning process. It is used for eLearning practices and, in its most common form, consists of two elements: a server that performs the base functionality and a user interface that is operated by instructors, students and administrators.LMS are frequently used by businesses of all sizes, national government agencies, local governments, traditional educational institutions and online/eLearning-based institutions. The systems can improve traditional educational methods, while also saving organizations time and money. An effective system will allow instructors and administrators to efficiently manage elements such as user registration, content, calendars, user access, communication, certifications and notifications.
# Basic Types of LMS
Cost, stability and security are key considerations in choosing a LMS. Based on market use, the following are the three categories of LMS:
1. Proprietary LMS
2. Standards-based LMS
3. Open architecture LMS
# Features of Learning Management Systems

1.  Scalability
2.  Cost Efficient 
3. 	Ease of Use
4. 	Integration

# Conclusion
Our overview of  College Learning management systems helped us to identify the software requirements specifications for a new LMS. These requirements include developing a system using Visual Studio and SQL server. Visual Studio has numerous advantages as it enhances performance through early binding, just-in-time functions, caching and native optimization. It also makes it easier for simple tasks like client authentication and submission of forms. We implemented the identified requirements in a new CLMS. We described CLMS, its design, and features, in detail. Our CLMS has several advantages. Finally, we identified the main areas in which CLMS could be improved. Some of these areas included enhancing the security features of CLMS adding forums, integration with social media and enabling notifications or message alerts. Other improvement suggestions were the inclusion of blended learning, gamification and video conferencing.
